 The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
 On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with 
 an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
 This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better 
 safety regulations for ships.One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such 
 loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. 
 Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, 
 some groups of people such as women, children, and the upper-class 
 were more likely to survive than others.

# Import a csv file

```{r Set up, data import and inspection}

cloud_wd <- getwd()
setwd(cloud_wd)

titanic <- read.csv("titanic.train.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```


# Examine the overall data frame

str() shows the number of observations, and the number, names, types and some values of columns


```{r structure aka str}
titanic %>% str()
```

## You can retrieve and save the number of rows and number of coloumns of a data frame
```{r nrow}

# create local variables for row and column numbers

row <- nrow(titanic)
row

#should be 891
```
```{r ncol}

col <- ncol(titanic)
col

#should be 12
```



## Show the head and tail rows of a data frame


```{r head function}

titanic %>% head() 

```

```{r tail function}

titanic %>% tail()
```

```{r head function override defaults}

titanic %>% head(10)

```

```{r tail function override defaults}

titanic %>% tail(7)

```

## summary() 

shows the mean and the five-number statistics indicating the spread of each column's values

summary()

```{r summary}

titanic %>% summary()

```



# Data transformation
Remove unique identifiers from further analysis as they are not interesting without additional feature extractions
### selecting columns

```{r select specific columns}

titanic %>% select(Sex, Age) %>% head()
```


### Remove columns
```{r Data transformation 1}

titanic <- titanic %>% select(-PassengerId, -Name, -Ticket)

```

### Factor categorical columns
Change Survived and other nominal variables to factors
Use structure to see data before and after the transformation
```{r Data str prior to factor}

titanic %>% str()

```


```{r Character variable factorization}

titanic$Survived <- factor(titanic$Survived)
titanic$Sex <- factor(titanic$Sex)
titanic$Pclass <- factor(titanic$Pclass)
# Cabin and Embarked is converted to Factor after the blank spaces have been removed in next code chunks as it was giving the error that: "Caused by error in `if_else()`: ! `false` must be a character vector, not a `factor` object." 
#titanic$Cabin <- factor(titanic$Cabin)
#titanic$Embarked <- factor(titanic$Embarked) 

knitr::include_graphics("titanic_error.png")

#tidyverse syntax
#titanic <- titanic %>% mutate(Cabin = factor(Cabin))

#Check your work to make sure factorization was successful

titanic %>% str()

```




Remove observations with missing Age values. 

This missing data handling approach has the obvious disadvantages of 
the applicability of the model to data with missing age.

To keep observations with missing Age values require careful imputation of Age missingness. 

The various missing data imputation methods are beyond the knowledge required for this tutorial.

```{r find columns with NA }

titanic %>% summarize(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.))))
```

### Drop columns
dropping columns from the dataframe
```{r drop columns  }
titanic <- titanic %>% drop_na()
```
On the other hand, keeping missing factor levels might be able to lead to meaningful models
Empty level names of the Cabin and Embarked factors will cause problems in some analysis.
Other missing factor value imputation remains a good option beyond the scope of this tutorial.

### Counts of empty strings in columns

```{r}
# Count empty strings in all columns
# filter to count all nonzero columns
titanic %>%
  summarize(across(everything(), ~ sum(. == ""))) #%>% 
  #t() %>%
  #as.data.frame() %>%
  #filter(V1>0)
```
```{r}
titanic <- titanic %>%
  mutate(Cabin = if_else(Cabin == "","Missing",Cabin),
         Embarked = if_else(Embarked == "","Missing",Embarked))

titanic %>%
  summarize(across(everything(), ~ sum(. == "")))

titanic$Cabin <- factor(titanic$Cabin)
titanic$Embarked <- factor(titanic$Embarked) 

# Checking that factorization worked properly
titanic %>% str()
```





# Understanding numeric variables

```{r referring to columns by name}

# base R version
summary(titanic[c("Sex", "Age")])

#tidyverse version
titanic %>% select(Sex,Age) %>% summary()

# YOU DO.
titanic %>% select(Sex,Age,Fare) %>% summary()
```
## Quantile function
Show summary of one or more columns

```{r quintile and decile}

# quantiles and deciles in Base R

quantile(titanic$Fare, seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.20))
quantile(titanic$Fare, seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.10))

# same in tidyverse
titanic %>% pull(Fare) %>% quantile(., seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.20))
titanic %>% pull(Fare) %>% quantile(., seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.10))

# now you do the same for Age
titanic %>% pull(Age) %>% quantile(., seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.20))
titanic %>% pull(Age) %>% quantile(., seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.10))
```
## Boxplots

Useful numeric visualization.

```{r boxplots}

# Base R
boxplot(titanic$Fare, main="Boxplot of Age in the titanic data set",
        ylab="Age")

# ggplot
# replace the following code with code to display Fare.
# change the title to reflect the new data. 

titanic %>% 
ggplot(aes(y=Fare)) + 
geom_boxplot() +
ggtitle('boxplot of Titanic Fare')

```
```{r histograms}

# histograms of a numeric variable

hist(titanic$Fare, main = "Histogram of Fare in the titanic data set",
     xlab = "Fare")

titanic %>% ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=Fare),binwidth = 20) +
  ggtitle('Histogram of Fare in the titanic data set')

# create a new histogram of Age using the following template

titanic %>% ggplot() +
geom_histogram(aes(x=Age),binwidth = 1) +
ggtitle('Histogram of Age in the titanic data set')

```

```{r variance and standard deviation}

#base R
var(titanic$Fare)
sd(titanic$Fare)

#tidyverse
titanic %>% pull(Fare) %>% var()
titanic %>% pull(Fare) %>% sd()


# now you do the same for Age 
var(titanic$Age)
sd(titanic$Age)



```
## Rounding

It's nice to be able to make numeric variables more readable. Consider rounding to improve readability.

```{r rounding}

titanic %>% select(Fare) %>% head()

# rounded
titanic %>% select(Fare) %>% round() %>% head()

# now you try for Age
titanic %>% select(Age) %>% round() %>% head()

```



## Understand relationship of multiple variables

Generate correlation coefficients of two numeric variables in a 2x2 matrix
 cor(X,Y) lies between -1 and 1. zero means no correlation. 1 or -1 indicates full correlation
 positive value means positive correlation and negative values mean negative relationships
 Examine the components in the formulation for correlation coefficients
 cor(X,Y) = cov(X,Y)/(sd(X)*sd(Y)) 
 cov(X,Y) = E[X-E(X)]*E[Y-E(Y)]
```{r Understand variable relationships }
# cor,  boxplot, 2D scatter plot - plot, 3D scatter plot

# scatter plot: two numeric variables
# base R
plot(titanic$Age, titanic$Fare)

# ggplot
titanic %>% ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x=Age,y=Fare))

cov(titanic[,c("Fare","Age")]) # this will display incorrect results if missing values are not removed
var(titanic[,c("Fare","Age")])
```

## pairs.panels

```{r pairs panels}
# Generate 2D scatter plots and correlation coefficients
# tidyverse 
# select only numeric variables for pairs panels. 
titanic %>% select(where(is.numeric)) %>% pairs.panels()

```


# Exploring factor variables

## nlevels(), is.factor()
```{r Explorating factor variables}
# A factor's distinct values

# base R
is.factor(titanic$Survived)
nlevels(titanic$Survived)

# tidy syntax
titanic %>% pull(Survived) %>% nlevels()

# now you do the same for Pclass

is.factor(titanic$Pclass)
nlevels(titanic$Pclass)
```
## Barplot

```{r barplot}

plot(titanic$Pclass,main="Barplot of Pclass")

#tidyveryse
titanic %>% ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x=Pclass)) +
  ggtitle("Barplot of Pclass")

# now you create a barplot for Sex
titanic %>% ggplot()+
  geom_bar(aes(x= Sex))+
  ggtitle("Barplot of Sex")

```
# Exploring Categorical grouped by Categorical (Factor by Factor)

```{r contingency table grouped}


# base R
table(titanic$Survived,titanic$Pclass) # shows the raw counts
prop.table(table(titanic$Survived,titanic$Pclass)) # shows the proportions
prop.table(table(titanic$Survived,titanic$Pclass))*100 # shows the percentages


# sort of tidyverse (ish)
titanic %>% select(Survived,Pclass) %>% table()
titanic %>% select(Survived,Pclass) %>% table() %>% prop.table() %>% round(2)
titanic %>% select(Survived,Pclass) %>% table() %>% prop.table() %>% round(2) * 100

# prop tables for sex and survived
table(titanic$Survived,titanic$Sex) # shows the raw counts
prop.table(table(titanic$Survived,titanic$Sex)) # shows the proportions
prop.table(table(titanic$Survived,titanic$Sex))*100 # shows the percentages

# now you create a barplot for Sex grouped by Survived
titanic %>% ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x=Sex,fill=Survived),position="dodge") +
  ggtitle("Barplot of Sex by Survived")


```



```{r barplot grouped}


#tidyveryse
titanic %>% ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x=Pclass,fill=Survived),position="dodge") +
  ggtitle("Barplot of Pclass by Survived")

# now you create a barplot for Sex grouped by Survived

titanic %>% ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x=Sex,fill=Survived),position="dodge") +
  ggtitle("Barplot of Sex by Survived")
```
Wow! A lot more passengers in Class 3 didn't survive than those who did. And conversely in Class 1 more passengers survived than did not. In Class 2 it was a bit of a mixed bag. 



Often simply looking at a single column is insufficient for the needs of the analysis. Being able to ask the question: When I group the data by a column, how do other columns behave? Is a more interesting and useful EDA task. For example: In the titanic how do the groups of passengers who survived differ from those who did not? Group our data by survived to explore this question.

# Exploring numeric variables by factors

## Boxplot 
This groups values of a numeric variable based on the values of a factor
```{r boxplot numeric values by factors}
# base R
boxplot(Age~Survived, data = titanic)

# Below change the graph to display the difference between Survived by Fare

titanic %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=Survived,y=Fare,color=Survived)) +
  ggtitle('Survived by Fare Boxplot') 




```
## The aggregate function
```{r Aggregation function}
# We can use the aggregate command to aggregate a numeric feature by a categorical one.

# The aggregate function has three parameters

# 1. The numeric value, e.g. sales, to be aggregated to find out, e.g., total of sales,
#   average of sales, number of sales (i.e. orders).

# 2. The set of categories, product_category and sales_region, on which you wish
#   to aggregate

# 3.The aggregation function (e.g., sum, mean, length) that you wish to use


# this will not show in output until Knit. 
aggregate(Fare~Survived, summary, data = titanic)

#tidyverse

titanic %>%
  group_by(Survived) %>%
  summarize(
    min = min(Fare),
    q1 = quantile(Fare, 0.25),
    median = median(Fare),
    mean = mean(Fare), # adding in mean as well
    q3 = quantile(Fare, 0.75),
    max = max(Fare)
  )
```
## Scatter plot of numeric values and factor values
```{r Scatter plat of numeric and factor variables}

plot(titanic$Age,titanic$Fare, col=titanic$Survived, pch = as.numeric((titanic$Survived)))

titanic %>% ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x=Age,y=Fare,color=Survived))
```
